## 📓 Summay

I started web engineer intern at Every Inc, which operates a large-scale media service with more than 100 million users, and started working as a web engineer while I was still a student. I joined Every Inc as a new graduate and was involved in the overall development of web applications. At the same time, I joined a start-up company developing 3D printers for construction as second job, which I was involved in both software and hardware development. While working at a hardware start-up, I change jobs to Money Forward Inc. where he is involved in the overall web development of SaaS services and recruiting engineers.
